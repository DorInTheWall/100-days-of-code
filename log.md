# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: Tuesday January 3rd

**Today's Progress**: Using a piece of paper (woah, old school!) to work out the solution to an extra curricular challenge from my Java OCP course. Also, forking a repo on github to create this log.

**Thoughts** I've got no idea if forking a repo on github is actually what I've done, but it makes me sound like I'm down with the kids so I'm going to stick with it. Also, I need a whiteboard and handwriting I can read.

**Link(s) to work**
Come to my home and look. I've still got some M&S Shortbread left.
