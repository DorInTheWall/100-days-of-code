# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: Tuesday January 3rd

**Today's Progress**: Using a piece of paper (woah, old school!) to work out the solution to an extra curricular challenge from my Java OCP course. Also, forking a repo on github to create this log.

**Thoughts** I've got no idea if forking a repo on github is actually what I've done, but it makes me sound like I'm down with the kids so I'm going to stick with it. Also, I need a whiteboard and handwriting I can read.

Come to my home and look. I've still got some M&S Shortbread left.

### Day 2: Wednesday January 4th

**Today's Progress**: I finished the extra curricuar challenge from yesterday. I have begun small program which will show the user a String and ask them to correctly state where the BoundaryMatches are.

**Thoughts** I have got a massive blind spot about /b and /B so this program is largly to help myself. As this is 100 days of code, I may expand it into a program which tests all the regex metacharacters. I'd also like to use GUI elements as they are something I haven't studied much.

On a piece of paper even less understandable than yesterday's.

### Day 3: Thursday January 5th

**Today's Progress**: Working on BoundaryExamination program. Got the generation of the random String working correctly, weighted to include spaces, and changes String if first or last character are a space. Looks as though all is good with it.

**Thoughts** Progress hampered by inability to read own handwriting, but it's moving forward. I'm struck by the realisation that I can actually *do* stuff. Which is nice.
