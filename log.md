# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: Tuesday January 3rd

**Today's Progress**: Using a piece of paper (woah, old school!) to work out the solution to an extra curricular challenge from my Java OCP course. Also, forking a repo on github to create this log.

**Thoughts** I've got no idea if forking a repo on github is actually what I've done, but it makes me sound like I'm down with the kids so I'm going to stick with it. Also, I need a whiteboard and handwriting I can read.

Come to my home and look. I've still got some M&S Shortbread left.

### Day 2: Wednesday January 4th

**Today's Progress**: I finished the extra curricuar challenge from yesterday. I have begun small program which will show the user a String and ask them to correctly state where the BoundaryMatches are.

**Thoughts** I have got a massive blind spot about /b and /B so this program is largly to help myself. As this is 100 days of code, I may expand it into a program which tests all the regex metacharacters. I'd also like to use GUI elements as they are something I haven't studied much.

On a piece of paper even less understandable than yesterday's.

### Day 3: Thursday January 5th

**Today's Progress**: Working on BoundaryExamination program. Got the generation of the random String working correctly, weighted to include spaces, and changes String if first or last character are a space. Looks as though all is good with it.

**Thoughts** Progress hampered by inability to read own handwriting, but it's moving forward. I'm struck by the realisation that I can actually *do* stuff. Which is nice.

### Day 4: Friday January 6th

**Today's Progress**: Not much done - only half an hour of File I/O practice exercises

**Thoughts** I probably could get another half hour done but my brain is knackered and cold and I have meatworld stuff which needs doing before dark. I'll probably try and get a better plan for the rest of BoundaryExamination down on paper later as I'm not completely happy with my current outline. Still. Some is better than nothing.

On my computer. If you feel a burning desire to know how good I am at File, FileWriter and BufferedWriter, please feel free to hack it.


### Day 5: Saturday January 7th

**Today's Progress**: More File I/O Exercises

**Thoughts** I'm feeling good about these. I was fairly comfortable with how they worked and this is cementing all that knowledge. Need a file/directory creating/deleting/written to/read from? Come at me, Bro. 
I feel a little bad about not getting more done on BoundaryExaminator, but I've got another 15-odd I/O to do by Wednesday and 70-odd NIO.2 to do for the following week. I'm clearly going to smash this challenge for the next week.

On my computer. Again.
